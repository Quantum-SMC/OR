The GitHub repository contains the implementation codes for a Quantum Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) protocol that enables two parties (namely Alice and Bob) to compute a wide range of symmetric Boolean functions such as AND, OR, Nor, etc. The implementation steps of the SMC protocol is given in the paper titled "Secure Multiparty Computation via Measurement-Based Quantum Computing." These codes are designed to be executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
